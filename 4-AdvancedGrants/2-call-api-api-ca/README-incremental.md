## Overview

This sample demonstrates a JavaScript single-page application (SPA) calling a middle-tier Node.js web API which in turn calls another Node.js web API down the stream, using [Azure AD OAuth 2.0 on-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). The downstream web API has a [conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) policy to enable [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa?toc=/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/toc.json&bc=/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/breadcrumb/toc.json) (MFA). As such, users have to perform MFA in order to access it. However, since the downstream web API has no user interaction capability, the [claims challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-error-handling-js#conditional-access-and-claims-challenges) generated by the conditional access policy needs to be *propagated back* to the SPA via the middle-tier web API.

## Scenario

1. The client uses the **MSAL.js** to sign-in and obtain a **JWT** access token from **Azure AD**.
1. The access token is used as a *bearer token* to authorize the user to call the **middle-tier web API** protected by **Azure AD**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** presents the token sent from client to **Azure AD** in order to receive a new token to call the **downstream web API**.
1. Because the **downstream web API** has a **conditional access** policy enabled (MFA), it generates a **claims challenge** and sends it back.
1. The **middle-tier web API** propagates the **claims challenge** back to client, which triggers an **interactive** token request.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure AD Premium P1 license (for enabling conditional access).

## Setup

Locate the project root folder in a command prompt. Then:

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..
    cd ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api2
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..
    cd ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-spa
    npm install
```

### Registration

In the previous tutorial, we have already registered a SPA (`ms-identity-javascript-c1s1-spa`) and a web API (middle-tier) (`ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api`). Here we will update those registrations, while registering a new web API (downstream).

### Register the downstream web API (ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `user_impersonation`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1 as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1 on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the downstream web API (ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `DownstreamAPI\config.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.

### Register the middle-tier web API (ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api2)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.

   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.

#### Configure Known Client Applications for the middle-tier web API (ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api2)

For a middle-tier web API (`ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api2`) to be able to call a downstream web API, the middle-tier app needs to be granted the required permissions as well. However, since the middle-tier cannot interact with the signed-in user, it needs to be explicitly bound to the client app in its **Azure AD** registration. This binding merges the permissions required by both the client and the middle-tier web API and presents it to the end user in a single consent dialog. The user then consent to this combined set of permissions.

To achieve this, you need to add the **Application Id** of the client app, in the Manifest of the web API in the `knownClientApplications` property. Here's how:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api2` app registration, and select **Manifest** section.
1. In the manifest editor, change the `"knownClientApplications": []` line so that the array contains the Client ID of the client application (`ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-spa`) as an element of the array.

    For instance:

    ```json
    "knownClientApplications": ["ca8dca8d-f828-4f08-82f5-325e1a1c6428"],
    ```

1. **Save** the changes to the manifest.

### Enable Conditional Access for the downstream web API

1. Inside the **Azure Active Directory** window, select the **Conditional Access** button near the bottom of the list under **Security**.

![CA1](./ReadmeFiles/ca1.png)

2. Select **New Policy** and name your policy.

![CA3](./ReadmeFiles/ca3.png)

3. Select the **Users and groups** button, select **All Users** in the **Include** tab.

![CA4](./ReadmeFiles/ca4.png)

4. Select the **Cloud apps**, then hit the **Select apps** radio button in the **Include** tab, and select the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s1-api1`.

![CA5](./ReadmeFiles/ca5.png)

5. Finally, select the **Grant** button and hit **Grant access**. Then check the **Require multi-factor authentication** option.

![CA6](./ReadmeFiles/ca6.png)

6. Enable the policy and save. Access to your web API now requires **multi-factor authentication**!

## About the code

### Handling conditional access claims challenge

If the conditional access policy is not satisfied when calling the downstream web API, Azure AD will throw an error together with a claims challenge. In our middle-tier web API, we are to catch this error coming from downstream web API, and send it to the client SPA. This is illustrated in the middle-tier web API [index.js](./MiddletierAPI/index.js) file:

```javascript
   try {
      // request new token and use it to call resource API on user's behalf
      let tokenObj = await getNewAccessToken(userToken);

      if (tokenObj['error_codes']) {
            
            /**
             * Conditional access MFA requirement generates AADSTS50076 error.
             * If this occurs, sample middle-tier API will propagate this to client
             * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
             */

            if (tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50076)) {
               return res.status(401).json(tokenObj);
            }
      }

      // access the resource with the token
      let apiResponse = await callResourceAPI(tokenObj['access_token'], config.resources.downstreamAPI.resourceUri)

      res.status(200).json(apiResponse);
   } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
      return res.status(500).json(error);
   }
```

Then, in the SPA project, we catch this error response and initiate an interactive token request with additional claims. To do so, we append the JSON object from the response to our [tokenRequest](./SPA/App/authConfig.js) object before triggering the interactive token request. This is illustrated in [api.js](./SPA/App/api.js):

```javascript
   // check for any errors
   if (response['error_codes']) {

      /**
       * Conditional access MFA requirement generates AADSTS50076 error.
       * If this occurs, sample middle-tier API will propagate this to client
       * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
       */
      if (response['error_codes'].includes(50076)) {

      // attach the stringified JSON claims challenge to token request 
      tokenRequest.claims = response['claims'];

      // calls the MSAL.js acquireToken* API
      passTokenToApi();
      }
   } else {
      // if no errors, display user name
      logMessage('Web API responded: Hello ' + response['name'] + '!');
   }
```
